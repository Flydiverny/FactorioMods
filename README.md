# Factorio Mods

Several mods for the Factorio game, each mod is described below.

## [Visual Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/zomis/visual-signals) (GUI Signal Display)

Allows players to keep track of circuit networks in the GUI at any time.

Originally based on [CircuitsUI by Fumelgo](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Fumelgo/CircuitsUI) but massively modified to become a mod on its own.

## [Lamp Placer](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/zomis/lamp-placer)

Lets the player select an area with a Lamp Placer tool to give orders to robots to place lamps in the area.

## [What is missing](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/zomis/what-is-missing)

The GUI will show when you place something on the map.

No need to run around checking why you are not producing so much as you want to. This mod will tell you about all things that are causing you to not produce as much research, build a rocket, or any items of your choice.

## Timeline

This mod will save timestamps (number of ticks that has passed in the game) for when certain actions are made. For example, it will save the times for when you research technologies, and timestamps for when you first place each kind of entity (transport belts, roboports, etc.)

Contains a remote interface so that other mods can also add marks to the timeline.

The timeline can be saved to a HTML file.

*Planned:* Filtering of the HTML file, adding marks for 1 million iron plates produced, and more.
