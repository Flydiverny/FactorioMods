# Factorio Mods

Several mods for the Factorio game, each mod is described below.

## [Visual Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/zomis/visual-signals) (GUI Signal Display)

Allows players to keep track of circuit networks in the GUI at any time.

Originally based on [CircuitsUI by Fumelgo](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Fumelgo/CircuitsUI) but massively modified to become a mod on its own.

## Empty Drills

- Sends you a message when a drill no longer has any resources.
- Click a button to see the closest empty drill.

*Planned:* Automatic deconstruction when there are no more resources.

## Monitor System

*Planned:* See information about what you are producing, and what you need to focus on in order to produce more. Like the 'P' key, but much more detailed.

## Timeline

This mod will save timestamps (number of ticks that has passed in the game) for when certain actions are made. For example, it will save the times for when you research technologies, and timestamps for when you first place each kind of entity (transport belts, roboports, etc.)

Contains a remote interface so that other mods can also add marks to the timeline.

The timeline can be saved to a HTML file.

*Planned:* Filtering of the HTML file, adding marks for 1 million iron plates produced, and more.
